# ViewComponent::Storybook

The ViewComponent::Storybook gem provides Ruby api for writing stories describing [View Components](https://github.com/github/view_component) and allowing them to be previewed and tested in [Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/)

## Features
* A Ruby DSL for writing Stories describing View Components
* A Rails controller backend for Storybook Server compatible with Strobook Controls Addon parameters
* Coming Soon: Rake tasks to watch View Components and Stories and trigger Storybook hot reloading

## Installation

### Gem Installation

1. Add the `view_component_storybook` gem, to your Gemfile: `gem 'view_component_storybook'`
2. Run `bundle install`.
3. Add `require "view_component/storybook/engine"` to `config/application.rb`
4. Add `**/*.stories.json` to `.gitignore`

### Storybook Installation

1. Add Storybook server as a dev dependedncy. The Storybook Controls addon isn't needed but is strongly recommended
   ```sh
   yarn add @storybook/server @storybook/addon-controls --dev
   ```
2. Add an NPM script to your package.json in order to start the storybook later in this guide
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "storybook": "start-storybook"
     }
   }
   ```
3. Create the .storybook/main.js file to configure Storybook to find the json stories the gem creates. Also configure the Controls addon:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     stories: ['../test/components/**/*.stories.json'],
     addons: [
       '@storybook/addon-controls',
     ],
   };
   ```
4. Create the .storybook/preview.js file to configure Storybook with the Rails application url to call for the html content of the stories
   ```javascript

   export const parameters = {
     server: {
       url: `http://localhost:3000/rails/stories`,
     },
   };
   ```


Note: `@storybook/server` will be part of the upcoming Storybook 6.0 release. Until that is released you'll need to use an [rc release](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/releases/tag/v6.0.0-rc.14)

## Usage

### Writing Stories

`ViewComponent::Storybook::Stories` provides a way to preview components in Storybook.

Suppose our app has a `ButtonComponent` that takes a `button_text` parameter:

```ruby
class ButtonComponent < ViewComponent::Base
  def initialize(button_text:)
    @button_text = button_text
  end
end
```

We can write a stories desecibing the `ButtonComponent`

```ruby
class ButtonComponentStories < ViewComponent::Storybook::Stories
  story(:with_short_text) do
    controls do
      text(:button_text, 'OK')
    end
  end

  story(:with_long_text) do
    controls do
      text(:button_text, 'Push Me Please!')
    end
  end
end
```

### Generating Storybook Stories JSON

Generate the Storybook JSON stories by tunning the rake task:
```sh
rake view_component_storybook:write_stories_json
```

### Start the Rails app and Storybook

In separate shells start the Rails app and Storybook

```sh
rails s
```
```sh
yarn storybook
```

Alternatively you can use tools like [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) to start both Rails and Storybook with one command.

### Configuration

By Default ViewComponent::Storybook expects to find stories in the folder `test/components/stories`. This can be configured but setting `stories_path` in `config/applicaion.rb`. For example is you're using RSpec you might set the following configuration:

```ruby
config.view_component_storybook.stories_path = Rails.root.join("spec/components/stories")
```

### The Story DSL

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
